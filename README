Crib stands for "Centralized housing of Resource and Inversion of control with lazy Binding".
This actually describes a lot of what this small class is doing. It foremost houses your classes so that you in an easy fashion can require them throughout your application.
Thanks to the inversion of control, the classes that are never required is never instanciated. 
The lazy binding makes sure that all implementation required from the crib gets its own reference to the crib and an init call to be able to bind/connect/initialize before being sent out to the function that required it.
